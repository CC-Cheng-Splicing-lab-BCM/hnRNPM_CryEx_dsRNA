# CryEx_hnRNPM
<<<<<<< HEAD
This repository contains the novel bioinformatics pipeline named "CryEx" that identifies any expressed exon from RNA-seq and some visualization analyses on the hnRNPM-repressed CryEx study. 

Part I: CryEx

## Toy example dataset 
Example of RNA-seq data on chromosome 21 is available at GitHub HTE1_chr21_sorted.bam, HTE1_chr21_sorted.bam.bai

## Preparing the reference genome sequences and gene annotation files

## Run CryEx pipeline step by step
### Step 1: 
bash CryEx_Boundaries.sh
### Step 2:
bash CryEx_len.sh
### Step 3:
bash SJ_STAR.sh
### Step 4:
bash SIMPLE_JUNC.sh

## Output format

## IGV and PCR validation

Part II: visualization analyses

### Thank you
Thank you for using CryEx pipeline and the visualization analyses!

### A python version of the CryEx pipeline that is more user-friendly is underdevelopment, please stay tuned! If you have any questions, please do not hesitate to contact me through GitHub or at my email: Rong.Zheng@bcm.edu
